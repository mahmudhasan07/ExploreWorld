This is a Blog site , which is build base on Next.js  and Tailwind CSS. This site is used to share user travel experience and e their enjoy movement on this website. For user attractive I use framer-motion  for animation. <br/>
 <b>Features:</b> 
 • In the navbar routes and cards section if you hover one to another route or card, you will see a background animation 
• I use a search filter to find the place or location they want to travel.
• I use the likes and comments section in blog details, where a user likes the blog it will always count him. 
• It has fast responsive comments.
• You can also see how many people like this and visit the profile of the person who liked it.
• It has a JWT authorization system to ensure that even if someone acquires your backend link, they cannot access your account or view your items
